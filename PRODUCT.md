- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can express their dining preferences, cravings, and constraints (e.g., "cheap sushi near downtown", "romantic Italian dinner") in plain English.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: The AI analyzes the user's input to provide tailored recommendations, falling back to general best-practices if specific data is unavailable.
